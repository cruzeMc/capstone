My name is Cruze McFarlane, a fourth year student doing a double major in Economics and Computer Science. My personal philosophy on life is that " results is what truly matters" , regardless of who you are, where you're from, what your economic conditions are, what family or personal struggles you have, none of it really matters or is important to the world unless you can defy the odds. Ten years from today, all those problems you have will become just a memory, fifty years after you're dead, nobody gives a crap. Your purpose now is to give meaning to all those struggles, to create a life that others can look at and relate to because you succeeded; in other words, your purpose is to produce results.

My hobbies include coding, reading, swimming, playing instruments, learning, working out, and flirting. My career goal is to be an entrepreneur, reason being, is that I like being the one who is in control, I like the fact that I'm the one who is firmly in charge of my own future, and I'm the one fully responsible for my own success or failure.

My contribution to the capstone project was a very mixed one. I must say firstly that I did not do everything on my own, and that I had a world class team to working with who contributed significantly to the success of this project. Regardless, I worked on the recommendation section which matches patrons to events that they would potentially like. I also worked on the "what if" section of the project which allowed promoters to be able to make projections regarding visitor turnout. I also touched on many other sections of the project such as the purchasing of tickets, the landing page, homepage, the user interface design, documenting the project, etc. Furthermore, I constantly challenged the group to aim higher and to constantly refine and produce better results.
